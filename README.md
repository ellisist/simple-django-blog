# simple-django-blog
A simple blog made with Django.
Based on the "[DIY Django Mini Blog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/django_assessment_blog)" from [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
 (Not exactly the same thing as what they describe - just a little blog I started based on that, that I will develop over time).
 
## This is NOT ready for deployment
There are a number of changes which need to be made before deployment--this project is currently in development and hasn't been put through any of the [Django deployment checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/deployment/checklist/).
There are some core features which haven't been finished yet, but once the essentials are covered the plan is to have a branch dedicated to development and put the master branch through the needed changes to be deployment-ready.
